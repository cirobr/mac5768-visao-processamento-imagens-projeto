    "Objetivos:\n",
    "* A partir de 1080 fotos coloridas de 10 categorias de objetos (originalDataset), criar duplicatas em escala de cinza e armazená-las na pasta originalGrayDataset.\n",
    "* A partir das imagens em escala cinza, obter um dataset aumentado e armazenar em augmentedDataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "As funções para geração do augmentedDataset são:\n",
    "* Escala de cinza\n",
    "* Soma do fundo da imagem (gradiente) com a imagem cinza\n",
    "* Log2 da imagem cinza\n",
    "* Função Gama (exponencial da imagem)\n",
    "* Média e convolução, com o uso de janela uniforme 3x3.\n"
